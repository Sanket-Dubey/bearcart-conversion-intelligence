#🛒 BearCart: E-Commerce Growth & Conversion Intelligence

Where is the biggest drop-off occurring in the conversion funnel?

Which marketing channels bring high-intent vs low-intent users?

How dependent is revenue on a limited set of products?

Which products contribute most to refund-related revenue loss?

How does device usage impact user behavior and conversions?
